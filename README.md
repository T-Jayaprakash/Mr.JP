# Mr.JP

This repository is a personal learning and practice space where I document my progress in **Data Structures, Algorithms, and core programming concepts** using **Java**.

The goal of this repo is not to showcase fancy projects, but to build **strong fundamentals** and consistent problem-solving habits.

---

## 📌 What this repository contains

- Java-based problem-solving practice
- Algorithmic patterns (arrays, matrices, traversal, logic building)
- Clean and readable code written for learning, not shortcuts
- Gradual improvement through consistent commits

---

## 🧠 Current Focus

- Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- Array and Matrix problems
- Pattern-based problem solving (e.g., Spiral Matrix)
- Writing clear and understandable Java code

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java  
- **Concepts:** DSA, Problem Solving, Algorithms  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, CLI

## 🚀 Why this repo exists

Most beginners rush to advanced topics without mastering the basics.  
This repository is my attempt to **slow down**, learn things the right way, and build a solid foundation that will actually help in interviews and real-world development.

---

## 📈 Progress

I regularly solve problems on platforms like LeetCode and try to:
- understand patterns instead of memorizing solutions
- apply the same logic across different problem variations
- improve code clarity step by step
